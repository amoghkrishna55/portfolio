                    I&apos;m a software engineer and I&apos;m in it because I love what I do. 
                    I love exploring computers at all levels of computation.
                    In my belief, what we do as software engineers is nothing less than magic.
                    A bunch of 1s and 0s at our command and we can make the computer do whatever we want.
                    Although Computer Science has been around for a small time period compared to other sciences, its growth 
                    has been exponential and it has changed the way we live our lives forever.

                    My primary work of line is writing robust and perfomant backend systems powering the web applications.
                    I&apos;ve also worked with frontend technologies including ReactJs, NextJS, and template based frameworks and have a good understanding of how the web works.
